# Alexnet-test

A convnet object detecting project using Tensorflow built for research testing. 
The Alexnet/train_AlexNet.py was originally created by Dr. Xiaotong Zhao and lqy.

mnist_alexnet.py was created by transplanting the AlexNet to the Cnn that we had ever created,using AlexNet to finish the sorting task in MNIST.

Alexnet/import.py was moderated from the code given by http://blog.csdn.net/wiinter_fdd/article/details/72835939 

P.S. Accidently uploaded part of the test pictures...
